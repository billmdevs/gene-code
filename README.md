Code and content for the final research project work on the *Predictive Analysis and Modeling of Disease Classes using Deep Learning and Genetic Microarray Data.*


**_Abstract_** ​:
Using machine learning approaches to develop a method that uses genetic microarray data to
predict disease classes. This study aims to implement and evaluate different machine 
learning techniques in prediction of diseases.
The dataset is extracted from a DNA microarray which measures the expression levels of large
numbers of genes simultaneously. Samples in the datasets represent patients; for each patient
7070 genes expressions (values) are measured in order to classify the patient’s disease into one
of the following cases: EPD, JPA, MED, MGL, RHB.
**_Keywords—_** ​ ​Disease prediction; Machine Learning Algorithm; Genetic microarray.
